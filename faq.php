							<b>My booking has been rejected, but my credit card has been charged? What do I do?</b><br>
							This is a very rare situation, and can occur in case of a network fluctuation at the venue at the time of confirming the transaction. In this case, a reverse request for the charge on your card will be sent by us the same day to the bank.<br><br>
							<b>The refund has still not been credited in my credit card account</b><br>
							As per our company policy, we send a reverse request to the bank by the end of the day. Depending on each bank's policy, it can sometimes take up to 15 working days for the reversal to take effect.<br><br>
